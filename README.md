Backend Deployment Link:- [budgetgpt.vercel.app](https://budgetgpt.vercel.app/)

An AI NLP-based Budget tracking Slack Bot

## Main Idea of the project

The idea of **BudgetGPT** is to make the process of analyzizng and recording transaction easier and what better than normal Human Language to record transactions. Hence, we will be leveraging ChatGPT API in integration with [**LANGCHAIN**](https://www.langchain.com/) to convert normal human language transaction like *"My salary 15000 credited"*, *"I gave 1500 to my sister"* etc. into a format that can be easilt processed by a programming language.

> For now, I have implemented this project as a **Slack BOT**, using the following Tech Stack.

## Tech Stack 

- Flask + SlackAPI (For Backend)
- MongoDB (For database)
- Vercel (Deployment)

## Example Transactions
